## Gas Streaks Integration

To integrate with your Gas Streaks app, use the webhook endpoints:

### Winner Announcement
```http
POST /webhook/winner
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "winner_address": "addr1...",
  "prize_amount": "150",
  "streak_length": "7",
  "game_id": "game-abc-123"
}
```

### New Prize Pool Announcement
```http
POST /webhook/new_pool
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "total_prize": "500",
  "game_id": "new-game-456"
}
```

### Integration Example

Add this to your Gas Streaks backend:

```python
import requests

def announce_winner_to_discord(winner_data):
    webhook_url = "https://your-bot-app.herokuapp.com/webhook/winner"
    
    payload = {
        "winner_address": winner_data["address"],
        "prize_amount": str(winner_data["prize"]),
        "streak_length": str(winner_data["streak"]),
        "game_id": winner_data["game_id"]
    }
    
    try:
        response = requests.post(webhook_url, json=payload, timeout=10)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            print("Winner announced to Discord!")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error announcing to Discord: {e}")
```

## Stats API Integration

The `!stats` command can fetch real-time data from your Gas Streaks API. Create an endpoint that returns JSON in this format:

### Stats API Endpoint

**GET** `/api/stats`

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "gas_streaks": {
    "active_games": 3,
    "total_players": 1247,
    "games_completed": 89,
    "total_ada_won": "12,450"
  },
  "prize_pools": {
    "pools": [450, 320, 180],
    "total_active": "950"
  },
  "community": {
    "discord_members": 1500,
    "verified_burpers": 892,
    "online_now": 234,
    "bot_status": "Online ‚úÖ"
  },
  "recent_activity": {
    "last_winner": "2 hours ago",
    "last_game": "45 minutes ago", 
    "new_members_today": 12,
    "messages_today": 234
  }
}
```

Set the `GAS_STREAKS_API_URL` environment variable to your stats endpoint. If not provided, the bot will use fallback stats with Discord-only data.

## File Structure

```
discord-bot/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bot.py                    # Main bot file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ webhook_integration.py    # Integration helper
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt          # Python dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Procfile                 # Heroku process file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ runtime.txt              # Python version
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                # This file
```

## Deployment Steps

1. **Prepare files**: All files are ready in the `discord-bot` folder
2. **Create Heroku app**: `heroku create your-bot-name`
3. **Set environment variables**: Add `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` in Heroku Config Vars
4. **Deploy**: Push to Heroku or connect GitHub repository
5. **Scale worker**: `heroku ps:scale worker=1`

## Troubleshooting

### Bot not responding
- Check if `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` is set correctly
- Verify bot permissions in Discord server
- Check Heroku logs: `heroku logs --tail`

### Verification not working
- Ensure "Burper" role exists and bot can manage it
- Check bot role hierarchy (bot role must be higher than "Burper")
- Verify the verification channel ID is correct

### Webhooks not working
- Ensure `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` is set to your Heroku app URL
- Check that your Gas Streaks app can reach the webhook endpoints
- Verify the JSON payload format matches the expected structure

## Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check Heroku logs for error messages
2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure Discord permissions are properly configured
4. Test with admin commands first before integrating webhooks

## Security Notes

- Never commit your Discord bot token to version control
- Use Heroku Config Vars for all sensitive information
- The webhook endpoints are public - consider adding authentication if needed
- Regularly rotate your Discord bot token for security

**Happy Burping! üéâ**
